	<P>I am 20 years old and I have an older brother and a younger brother.  I am currently majoring in Accounting and I am a sophomore.  I graduated from Bangor High in 2015.  I originally came to UMaine for Mechanical Engineering and then after the first day of classes, realized that it wasn't for me.  I am a cashier at Walmart in Bangor.  I tend to spend every Sunday during Autumn and Winter watching football.  My favorite football team in the Cincinnati Bengals.  I play in a slow pitch softball league with my older brother and father and that is run through Bangor Parks and Rec.  I like to spend as much time outside as possible whether that is hiking, mowing the lawn, going for walks, or just exploring the woods.</P>
